# Differentiating-Spam-and-Ham-Mails
This is a project which is used to separate Spam mails from ham mails. This helps people to easily track important mails rather than losing track of mails due to periodic occurrence of spam mails . Efficiency of mail handling increases by this project and it helps people save time in searching important mails too.
